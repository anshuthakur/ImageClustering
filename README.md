# Grouping images into distinct products 

Based on the images given, the task is to group the images into distinct product types.

## Getting Started

To run the code, place the images into `pics/` folder and run all the cells in `image_clustering.ipynb` notebook.

### Prerequisites

Python packages - 
 - Numpy
 - opencv-python
 - Tensorflow (2.2)

## Notes
The code currently uses Pretrained ResNet50 to get the features from the images and then clusters them into groups using Scikit-learn's K-Means Clustering Algorithm.
